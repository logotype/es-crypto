# sha512-es
Cryptographic hash library producing a 512-bit (64-byte) hash value

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/logotype/es-crypto.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/logotype/es-crypto) [![NPM Version](https://badge.fury.io/js/sha512-es.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/sha512-es)

node
----

Import `SHA512` and call `.hash()` with a string (you might need to transpile the codebase from ES6 due to lack of support for modules and other features):

```javascript
import SHA512 from 'sha512-es';
const hash = SHA512.hash('abc');
console.log(hash);
```

Example output:

```bash
ddaf35a193617abacc417349ae20413112e6fa4e89a97ea20a9eeee64b55d39a2192992a274fc1a836ba3c23a3feebbd454d4423643ce80e2a9ac94fa54ca49f
```

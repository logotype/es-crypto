# sha256-es
Cryptographic hash library producing a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/logotype/sha256-es.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/logotype/sha256-es) [![NPM Version](https://badge.fury.io/js/sha256-es.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/sha256-es)

node
----

Import `SHA256` and call `.hash()` with a string (you might need to transpile the codebase from ES6 due to lack of support for modules and other features):

```javascript
import SHA256 from 'sha256-es';
const hash = SHA256.hash('abc');
console.log(hash);
```

Example output:

```bash
ba7816bf8f01cfea414140de5dae2223b00361a396177a9cb410ff61f20015ad
```
